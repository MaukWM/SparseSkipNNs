these were the first complete run of experiments

some issues:
ratio was not properly fixed during training, you can see this when plotting the actualized sparsity ratios,
higher sparsities went for lower ratio (more shortcut connections)

flop calculation is not complete here, flops required for pruning/regrowing are not included
